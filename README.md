Pandemonium
-------------

Most "beta launches" are considered to be pre-release software. There are no out-of-the-box solutions that integrate beta web-applications with the site. Instead developers are forced into building the functionality into the site.

Additionally, the functionality that exists is limited because it has to be recreated each time. This builds the module such that you only need to style up your templates.

Planned Features:
 - Registration
 - Account Creation
 - Account Management
 - Email Notifications
 - Activation
 - Plugins to link directly to bug tracking systems
   - Jira
   - Github


Usage
-------------

Place the module in your <axiom_root>/modules directory.
Add the module to your app.properties file.
